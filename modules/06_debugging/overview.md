- Mission: Sanitizers, gdb/gdbserver, artifacts.
- Context: applies to platform core (bounded queues, bus, pipeline) and hardware/GPU tracks where noted.
- You will: complete 3 targeted exercises, capture artifacts, run tests/benchmarks, and update checklists.
- Tooling: CMake presets (`dev`, `release`, `asan`, `cuda`, `aarch64`), scripts in `scripts/`, GoogleTest/Benchmark.
- Output: artifacts logs, brief self-review, mastery proof.
